# DnD Initiative Tracker

This is a simple app meant to keep track of the initiative order of creatures in combat in Dungeons & Dragons and perhaps many other TTRPGs. My goal here is to ignore my need for perfectionism and learning theory and get my hands dirty. The MVP of this project will be the following:

- A user will be able to go to the web app and input relevant character information and what they rolled
- The program will sort these characters in order of highest to lowest initiative
- Clear the state when the initiative is done

## Nice to Have

- button to iterate through the cards and show who is active
- this will have an animation tied to it
- status effects the creature is currently under
- concentration spells they have up
- weapons used and their damage
